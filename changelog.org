#+TITLE: rfc-mode changelog

* Next Version

** Features

- ~rfc-mode-read~ now supports a numeric prefix argument, so you can
  simply type ~C-u 1 2 3 4 M-x rfc-mode-read~ to read RFC number 1234.

* 1.3.0
This release improves navigation and introduce section detection, thanks to
Daniel Mart√≠n.

** Features
- ~imenu~ integration. If you use a graphical user interface, the menu
  bar will show a new menu, "RFC Contents", with links to the
  different parts of an RFC document.
- RFC links can now be navigated using the mouse, or by pressing
  ~<Tab>~/~<S-Tab>~.
- Pressing ~g~ in a ~rfc-mode~ buffer lets you navigate to an RFC
  section by name.
- You can navigate to previous and next RFC sections by pressing ~p~ and
  ~n~, respectively.

** Misc
- Derive ~rfc-mode~ from ~special-mode~.
- Make ~rfc-mode-read~ display the document in a separate window,
  without switching buffers. This follows the typical Emacs convention
  for displaying help buffers, like ~help-mode~ or ~man-mode~ follow.

* 1.2.0
This new release is driven by suggestions from Stefan Monnier and some issues
which were open on Github. Thanks everyone!

- Auto load ~rfc-mode-read~.
- Improved accuracy for section title detection.
- Offer the possibility to keep original buffer names with

** Fixes
- Compute the index path dynamically so that ~rfc-mode-directory~ can be
  modified after the module has been loaded.
